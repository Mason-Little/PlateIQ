# OptiSet

**Train smarter. Load faster. Progress intentionally.**

OptiSet is a modern, science-based workout tracking app designed for lifters who want to **optimize training decisions**, not just log workouts.  
Instead of starting from scratch every session, OptiSet tells you **what to do this time** — based on what you did last time, what you haven’t trained recently, and how to minimize friction in the gym.

## Why OptiSet?

Most workout trackers answer _“what did I do?”_  
OptiSet answers _“what should I do next?”_

- No empty days — your plan is always waiting
- No guesswork — progression is guided, not random
- No wasted time — loading and unloading plates is optimized
- No vague muscle groups — training is broken down by **muscle heads**

Built for lifters who care about **progressive overload, volume distribution, and execution quality**.

## Core Concepts

### 🧠 Ghosted Guidance (Default Experience)

There is no blank or empty state.

When you open OptiSet:

- You see **today’s routine**
- Exercises from the **last time you ran that routine** appear in a ghosted state
- Previous sets, reps, and weight are visible as guidance
- You decide whether to match, exceed, or vary the stimulus

Your workout feels _prepared_, not improvised.

### 🧬 Muscle Head Awareness

OptiSet goes beyond “train biceps” or “train triceps”.

It actively tracks and rotates emphasis across **muscle heads**, for example:

- **Biceps**
  - Long head
  - Short head
- **Triceps**
  - Long head
  - Lateral head
  - Medial head
- **Shoulders**
  - Anterior
  - Lateral
  - Posterior

If you’ve been biasing one head too frequently, OptiSet will suggest exercises that shift stimulus to under-trained heads — helping you train more **completely and intentionally**.

### 🔁 Intelligent Variation (Without Randomness)

OptiSet helps you switch things up _when it actually matters_:

- Exercise swaps that preserve movement patterns
- Rep range shifts to manage fatigue
- Load suggestions based on recent performance
- Volume balance across weeks

Variation is applied **deliberately**, not for novelty.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Buddy Load System (Shared Rack Optimization)

Training with a partner shouldn’t mean constantly stripping plates.

OptiSet introduces a **Buddy Load System**:

- When multiple lifters share a session or lobby
- The app calculates **optimal plate stacks**
- Finds shared working weights that minimize on/off movements
- Reduces downtime and friction at the rack

Example:

> One lifter benches 80 lb, another benches 155 lb  
> OptiSet computes the most efficient shared plate configuration.

This is especially powerful for:

- Training partners
- Small group sessions
- Busy gyms

---

## Training Structure

OptiSet supports both **custom plans** and **science-based defaults**, such as:

- Upper / Lower / Rest
- Chest + Biceps
- Back + Triceps
- Shoulders + Forearms
- Legs

Each routine adapts over time based on:

- Exercise history
- Muscle head distribution
- Recovery patterns
- Partner constraints (if applicable)

---

## UI & Experience

- Glass-inspired, modern interface
- Calm, off-grey color system (light & dark mode)
- Data-forward, minimal typography
- Gesture-based navigation
- No clutter, no journaling, no noise

Built for **mobile-first usage**, implemented as a modern web app.

---

## Status

🚧 **Early development / active iteration**

The core ideas, interaction model, and design language are actively being refined.

Planned focus areas:

- Exercise intelligence engine
- Muscle head tracking
- Plate optimization algorithms
- Shared workout lobbies
- Progressive overload heuristics

---

## Philosophy

OptiSet is built on a simple belief:

> Better decisions compound faster than harder workouts.

If you care about **how** you train — not just that you trained — this app is for you.
